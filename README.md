Challenge 2
Write code that will log to the console "Interval Hello!"
every 2 seconds (see setInterval).

1) Use the given clearAllIntervals function to clear all the messages
when you have this functionality working.

2) Next, modify your code so that the "Interval Hello!" messages
will automatically stop after 10 seconds.

3) Then, modify your code again so that the "Interval Hello!" messages
will automatically stop after 10 seconds
without use of the clearAllIntervals function,
and using clearInterval only once.
Perform research if you are unsure how to do this.
