Promises
http://csbin.io/promises




Challenge 6
This challenge we'll chain promises together using ".then"

Create two variables: firstPromise and secondPromise

Set secondPromise to be a promise that resolves to "Second!"

Set firstPromise to be a promise that resolves to secondPromise

Call the firstPromise with a ".then", which will return the secondPromise> promise.

Then print the contents of the promise after it has been resolved by passing console.log to .then
